# ForensicsProject-CrimeAtTheStable
This project focuses on the forensic investigation of data collected from a smartwatch to determine whether a suspect was present at the crime scene during a specific timeframe. Smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch, continuously collect extensive user data—including heart rate, GPS location, exercise logs, energy burned, and activity duration—which can be extracted and analyzed for forensic purposes.

Using the Apple Watch's Fitness app and exporting the data through the Health app, investigators extracted the smartwatch data in XML format and converted it into CSV for deeper analysis. The exported data contained detailed information about the suspect’s physical activities, including exercise types, start and end times, duration, heart rate patterns, calories burned, and precise GPS coordinates.

During the investigation, the smartwatch showed that the suspect was engaged in multiple exercises between 15:45 and 17:10, which aligned entirely with the time of the incident (15:30–17:00). The GPS data confirmed that the suspect was inside a gym, not at the crime scene. Additionally, investigators confirmed that traveling from the gym to the stable—where the crime took place—required approximately two hours, making it impossible for the suspect to be involved. He only reached the stable at 19:00, just minutes before the crime was discovered at 19:03.

Through analyzing the smartwatch’s biometric, geographical, and activity data, investigators were able to prove the suspect’s innocence, demonstrating the significant role smartwatches play in modern digital forensic investigations. The project also highlights additional forms of smartwatch data such as environmental audio exposure, standing time, floors climbed, and blood pressure metrics—all of which can enhance forensic insights.
